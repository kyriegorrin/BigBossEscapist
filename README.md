<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This script is for pretending that you're doing something worthwile with your time and avoid getting your PC to an idle status. It's more a proof of concept than anything else. Use at your own risk of getting fired. Intended for Linux machines (tested on Ubuntu).

The script used to move windows around is not my work, full credits to: ebattenberg/move-window

The stud.sh is just filler that I got from a random benchmark script: Cyclenerd/benchmark/blob/master/benchmark.sh
